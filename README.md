# TrackMyRide

### Android App for my Mobile Development Course

### JavaDoc is included in the Project files

### Small Problem for the Tests: 
Running the instrumented Tests may require you to manually accept Notfication Permissions in the Emulator. I couldnt figure out why and when the Tests automaticly fail if i handle the Permission with a Test Rule. 
It does it on some of my Computers but not all even with the same emulated Devices.
